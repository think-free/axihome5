# axihome5
Fifth version of Home Automation server Axihome

This is a complete rewrite of Axihome
It's based on Mqtt for communication and Docker for plugins and application tasks.
Mainly written in Go for backend; Frontend is Web based on react.js (and will be based on Flutter and Qt/Qml for native application), plugins are language agnostics if you respect conventions.

User and Developers documentation is on the road (look at the doc folder but it's probably not up to date). If you are interested to use or hack it, please contact me !
